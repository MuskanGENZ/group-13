    </h2>
    <p className="lead text-muted">
   <i>
The Bridge Pose stretches the chest, neck, and spine. It helps to calm your mind and alleviate the stress built up in your body.

Begin by lying down on your back and palms facing down at the sides. Bend your knees so that your heels are as close as possible to your buttocks.

Exhale and press the soles of your feet and arms against the floor. Push your hip upwards while keeping your buttocks firm. Now clasp your hands below and extend your arms to stay on top of your shoulders.

Keep your knees directly perpendicular to your heels and firm your shoulder blades against your back.

    </h2>
    <p className="lead text-muted">
    <i> 
    The Fish Pose is an amazing pose to it before bed or after a long drive.

Begin by lying down on your back on the floor. Bend your knees and lift your pelvis slightly off the floor. Now slide your hands below your buttocks with the palms facing down.

Rest your buttocks on your hands. Keep your forearms and elbows close to the sides of your torso. Next, inhale and press your forearms and elbows firmly against the ground.

While doing that, you will also need to press your scapulas into your back. Lift your upper torso and head until they are away from the floor. Arch your back and lift your chest as much as possible.

At this point, you can now release your head back onto the floor, so the back of your head will rest on the floor. Your head should feel only a minimal amount of weight.

You can either straighten your knees or remain bent. If you choose the former, you will need to apply pressure on your heels against the floor.

Hold this pose for at least 1 minute.

    <p className="text-muted lead">
    <i> For anyone that is tied to a desk, this is one of the best yoga poses for correcting bad posture. You can do this anytime every day in the office or the comfort of your home.

If you’re sitting on a chair, have both of your feet grounded on the floor. Or if you’re at home, you can seat on the floor comfortably.

Lift your right arm towards the ceiling, then bend your right elbow so that your right fingers are down your back. Now bring your left arm behind your back and try to have your left fingers reach your right fingers.

If your fingers can touch each other, use your right fingers to grab hold of your left fingers. You can use a yoga strap or towel to bridge the gap between your hands if you can’t touch each other.

Finally, draw the elbows back and lift your chest.

Hold this position for 30 seconds and switch sides.</i>

    </h2>
    <p className="text-muted lead">
    <i> The Camel Pose is great for undoing all the slouching that you do unintentionally at work or home.

Begin by kneeling on the floor with your knees hip-width apart. Have your toes tucked under and rest your hands on the back of your pelvis.

Lightly press your hips forward, lift your heart by pushing your shoulder blades against your back ribs. Slowly lean back against the shoulder blades and tailbone.

Lean until you can touch your feet with both hands simultaneously while keeping both your thighs perpendicular to the floor.

For beginners, you may find it hard to drop into the pose straightaway. You can tilt your torso to one side to get one hand on one of your feet. Then turn your torso back to neutral and lean back to touch the other foot with the other hand.

Hold for 30 seconds.It improves your posture and counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting, slouching, and kyphosis (abnormal curvature of the spine). </i>

    <i>  The Plank Pose is to build up your core strength because a bad posture may also be contributed by a weak core! So, you need to start improving your core strength today.

Go into a table-top position and spread your fingers wide. Press your hands against the floor and lift your knees until your legs are straight.

Makes sure your hips are in line with your shoulders and back. Keep your core tight and try to resist your tailbone from sinking towards the floor.

Hold for at least 30 seconds.As the Plank Pose is more to do with balance and strength and less of stretch, a lot of emphasis is on the muscles at the core and the shoulders.</i>

    <i>  To have a good posture is to stand tall and proud like a warrior. The Warrior I Pose can help you build confidence and better posture.

From the previous pose, Downward Facing Dog, step your left foot in between your hands. Rotate your back foot 45 degrees outwards. Bend your front knee until your thigh is parallel to the floor.

Now reach the sky with your fingertips by lifting your chest away from your pelvis. Feel the stretch across the belly and chest to your arms. Draw your shoulder blades down your back and keep your gaze forward, or tilt it back a little to look up.

    </h2>
    <p className="text-muted lead">
    <i>  There are many variations for the Wide-Legged Forward Fold. No matter which variation you’re doing, it will greatly help to lengthen the entire spinal column. We will be looking into the variation with your fingers behind you back for this one.

Begin by standing with both your feet hips-width apart or what feels comfortable for your body.

Have both your fingers behind your back and interlace them. Inhale and gaze upward toward the ceiling while keeping your neck long. Draw the palms closer to each other.

Now exhale and fold forward slowly, try to hang up and hold your hands together. If you find that your hands are not flexible enough to interlace, you can use a less intense method that is holding onto a yoga strap or a towel behind your back.

Keep your core engaged and hold this pose for 30 seconds.</i>
