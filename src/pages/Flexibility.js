    </h2>
    <p className="lead text-muted">
   <i>Standing Side Bend is not just merely performing a standing and bending stretch. You have to focus on breathing while you stretch. With each exhale, you stretch your body a little more and open up the muscle tissues around your rib cage and spine.
       How to do the Standing Side Bend:
Stand tall with both your feet and legs together. On inhale, reach both arms straight up towards the ceiling. On exhale, hold your hands together and lower your right arm down towards the right side of your body. At the same time, bend right from the waist. Hold this pose for 5 breaths. As you exhale, lengthen the left arm over the head and bend your body deeper to the right.To release, inhale and bend back to the center from your waist, returning your arms to center. Repeat on the left side for 5 breaths.
Tips: As you bend to the side, squeeze and engage your core, glutes and quadriceps completely. </i>

</h2>
<p className="text-muted lead">
<i>Doing the standing forward bend stretches the hamstrings, calves, hips and your upper back.

This pose is especially great for tight and tired upper back muscles.
Stand with your heels slightly apart. On exhale, bend forward from your hip joints (not from the waist). Like all the forward bends, the focus is on lengthening of the front torso as you move into the position fully.
Cross your forearms and hold your elbows. Press your heels firmly into the floor and try to lift your butt towards the ceiling.
As you inhale, lengthen the front torso slightly, and on exhale, release a little more into the forward bend. Allow your head to hang.
Hold this pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
To release, bring your hands onto your hips. On inhale, press your tailbone down and into the pelvis and come up with a long front torso.

Begin going into a plank position with your hands directly below your shoulders.
