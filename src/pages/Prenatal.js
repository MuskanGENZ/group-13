                During the second trimester, your body starts to produce higher
                levels of the hormone relaxin. It relaxes your tendons, muscles,
                and ligaments to prepare your body for birth. Since this may
                cause you to become more flexible, be careful not to
                overstretch. To prevent discomfort and injury, don’t go all the
                way to your edge. During the second trimester, you should avoid:
                intense backbends, twists, and forward bends strong or forceful
                abdominal contractions inversions (unless you’re very
                experienced) jumping, hopping, or bouncing hot yoga lying on

                  The butterfly stretch boosts circulation, stimulates your

                  flexibility in your low back, hips, and inner thighs, which
                  helps prepare your body for delivery. Sit on the edge of a

                  tilt forward. Press the soles of your feet together. Bring

                  times. Modifications: Place cushions or blocks under your
                  thighs or knees for support. Place a high stack of cushions
                  behind you. Lie back in a supported reclined position, keeping

                  Warrior II improves circulation, strengthens your whole body,
                  and opens your hips. It also relieves neck and back pain. This
                  pose allows you to experiment with your center of gravity as
                  you align your body. From standing, step left foot back and
                  turn toes out to the left slightly. Align the inside of left
                  foot so it’s in line with right heel. Open your hips to face
                  the side. Raise your arms to be parallel to the floor, with
                  palms facing down. Bend right knee, making sure it doesn’t
                  extend past your ankle. Gaze over your front middle finger.
                  Hold this pose for 30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.
                  Modifications: Do this pose next to a wall for support. Place
                  a chair under your front thigh. To reduce the intensity,
                  decrease the bend in your front knee, shorten your stance, or
                  step your back foot out to the side slightly.The standing posture opens your hips and strengthens and stretches your legs and ankles.

      This deep squat opens your hips and boosts digestion. Avoid
                  this pose if you’re prone to prolapse. Stand with feet
                  slightly wider than hips and toes turned out at an angle.
                  Slowly bend knees and lower your hips. Lift your heels or
                  place them on the floor. Press palms together at the center of
                  your chest. Press elbows into knees. Hold this position for up
                  to 30 seconds. Modifications: Sit on a block or stack of
                  cushions for support. Position yourself near a wall or chair
                  for balance. Place a folded blanket under your heels for

                  This classic seated pose lengthens your spine, opens your
                  hips, and promotes mental clarity. Sit on the edge of a
                  cushion, block, or folded blanket, allowing your pelvis to
                  tilt forward. Cross right leg over left leg. Place hands in
                  any comfortable position. Close your eyes and breathe deeply.
                  Hold this position for up to 1 minute. Repeat on the other
                  side. Modifications: Place cushions or blocks under your knees
                  for support. If it’s more comfortable, place one leg in front
                  of the other. Sit with your back against a wall to support
                  your spine. Easy Pose may also help lower or regulate blood pressure.
