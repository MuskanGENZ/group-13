<h2 className="text-md"><i>I think we can all agree that having quality sleep every day is important, right?</i></h2>
<p class="lead mb-4 text-muted">
<i>
Having a sleepless night will often lead to feeling zombified, cranky, and unproductive the next day. More importantly, it isn’t healthy in the long run.

For some, falling asleep and getting quality sleep might be a daily struggle. But here’s a natural way to solve that – yoga!
While some yoga poses focus on helping you build strength and energy, there are other yoga poses that can help you relax your body and mind. By getting into the relaxed state, you are able to fall asleep easier, stay in deep sleep, and wake up refreshed for the next day.

The best part of it is, you can achieve relaxation and better sleep by doing a short, gentle yoga sequence in the comfort of your own home.

Think of it as a healthy, unwinding session after the end of a busy day.

      <span className="">1. Standing Forward Bend (Uttanasana)</span>
    </h2>
    <p className="lead text-muted">
   <i>Begin with standing with your feet six inches apart.
  Gently fold your torso towards the ground. Just like all forward bends, the emphasis is on lengthening the torso as you enter the pose fully. 
  With your knees straight, bring your fingers to the floor beside your feet or slightly in front.
 If you cannot straighten your knees, don’t worry. You can cross your arms and hold the opposite elbows.
    On Inhale, lengthen the front torso slightly. And on exhale, relax and release into the forward bend a little deeper.
    Let your head hang between the shoulder blades.
    Hold this pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
    When coming up, bring your hands to your hips, press your tailbone down into the pelvis and slowly come up with a long front torso. Standing Forward Bend calms the brain and helps relieve stress. This pose also stimulates the liver and kidneys, and stretches the hamstrings, calves, and hips.</i>

</h2>
<p className="text-muted lead">
<i>From Downward-Facing Dog, simply bend your knees and lower your butt to your heels as you bring your chest toward the floor over your knees. Lower your shoulders and head to the floor. Place your arms along your sides, palms down, or you can support your head by folding your arms under your forehead. Breathe and relax for as long as you need to.It awakens the connection between the breath and body and sends calming energy through all the muscles. It’s an opportunity to get grounded, go inward, and to come out of your busy mind and into your body by awakening your breath from the inside out. Child’s Pose is a great way to take a break and relax during your yoga practice, or anytime you feel tired or overwhelmed.
Hold this position for 30 seconds to several minutes or however long you like.

    </h2>
    <p>
    <i className="text-muted lead">
     Begin with your legs straight up the wall.
