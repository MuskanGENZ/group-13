Start by placing both hands on the mat in front of you, palms down; your hands should be slightly in front of your shoulders. Place your knees on the ground directly under your hips. Exhale as you lift your knees off the ground and lift your buttocks and hips toward the ceiling. Push the top of your thighs back and stretch your heels down toward the floor. Keep your head down between your upper arms and in line with them, not hanging down. If you notice your lower back rounding, try bending your knees to help lengthen your back.“Downward-Facing Dog calms the nervous system, works on overall flexibility, decompresses the spine, tones the arms, sculpts the legs, and opens the shoulders,” says Cullis. The pose is often held for five breaths between sides, or longer for more strength-building benefits. Lengthen from your wrists to your hips on your inhales, and deepen your roots from your hips to your heels with each exhale, suggests Cullis."</i>

Lower your shoulders and head to the floor. Place your arms along your sides, palms down, or you can support your head by folding your arms under your forehead. Breathe and relax for as long as you need to.“Child’s Pose is one of the most healing yoga poses, and it’s my favorite of them all,” says Cullis. “It awakens the connection between the breath and body and sends calming energy through all the muscles. It’s an opportunity to get grounded, go inward, and to come out of your busy mind and into your body by awakening your breath from the inside out.” Child’s Pose is a great way to take a break and relax during your yoga practice, or anytime you feel tired or overwhelmed.</i>

Lower your upper body over the bent leg, either all the way to the floor or resting on your elbows. Slowly inhale and exhale five times. Before you change sides, push back on your left leg to stretch the calf muscles. Repeat with your left leg bent and right leg extended.This pose is a favorite for runners because it boosts hip flexibility and also releases the glutes and low back, Lawrence says. "If you run, lift weights, do CrossFit, or Spin, you must do this stretch to keep strong and flexible and enhance your performance." It may be challenging at first, but you'll learn to love this pose, Lawrence promises."</i>

                suggests Cullis.

                From Downward-Facing Dog, simply bend your knees and lower your
                butt to your heels as you bring your chest toward the floor over
                your knees. Lower your shoulders and head to the floor. Place
                your arms along your sides, palms down, or you can support your
                head by folding your arms under your forehead. Breathe and relax
                for as long as you need to.“Child’s Pose is one of the most
                healing yoga poses, and it’s my favorite of them all,” says
                Cullis. “It awakens the connection between the breath and body
                and sends calming energy through all the muscles. It’s an
                opportunity to get grounded, go inward, and to come out of your
                busy mind and into your body by awakening your breath from the
                inside out.” Child’s Pose is a great way to take a break and
                relax during your yoga practice, or anytime you feel tired or
                overwhelmed.

                From all fours, move your right knee forward between your hands.
                As though you were doing a lunge, slowly straighten your left
                leg behind you, keeping the knee and top of the foot on the
                floor. Now rotate the right knee toward the right wrist and
                bring it down to the floor with your right calf flat on the
                floor and your right foot resting under your left groin. Lower
                your upper body over the bent leg, either all the way to the
                floor or resting on your elbows. Slowly inhale and exhale five
                times. Before you change sides, push back on your left leg to
                stretch the calf muscles. Repeat with your left leg bent and
                right leg extended.This pose is a favorite for runners because
                it boosts hip flexibility and also releases the glutes and low
                back, Lawrence says. "If you run, lift weights, do CrossFit, or
                Spin, you must do this stretch to keep strong and flexible and
                enhance your performance." It may be challenging at first, but
                you'll learn to love this pose, Lawrence promises.

                Stand still, with your chest open and broad and your hands at
                your sides, and feel your feet on the floor and the sensations
                in your legs and back. Then analyze your posture in front of a
                mirror. Lawrence makes her athletes hold long pencils in each
                hand as they stand. "I tell them to look down at the pencils
                and, like a compass, see how they point. Are they the same? Does
                one point straight and the other point to three on the
                clock?"This pose will show if you have any imbalances in your
                shoulders and give you clues about what you need to work on. If
                one pencil is very turned in, so is your shoulder.

                This is a great ending pose for beginners and those experienced
                at yoga alike. Lie on the floor with your butt right up against
                a wall. "Walk" your legs straight up the wall so that your body
                is in an L shape with your torso flat on the floor and
                perpendicular to the wall. You may want to place a rolled-up
                blanket under your lower back for support; keep your elbows out
                to the sides on the floor for additional support. Flex toes to
                feel a stretch in the backs of your legs. Breathe deeply and
                hold the position for as long as you like. To release, bring
                your knees to your chest and roll over to your side.
