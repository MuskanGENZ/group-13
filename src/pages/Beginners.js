Exhale as you lift your knees off the ground and lift your buttocks and hips toward the ceiling. Push the top of your thighs back and stretch your heels down toward the floor. Keep your head down between your upper arms and in line with them, not hanging down. If you notice your lower back rounding, try bending your knees to help lengthen your back.Downward-Facing Dog calms the nervous system, works on overall flexibility, decompresses the spine, tones the arms, sculpts the legs, and opens the shoulders.

Breathe and relax for as long as you need to.It awakens the connection between the breath and body and sends calming energy through all the muscles. It’s an opportunity to get grounded, go inward, and to come out of your busy mind and into your body by awakening your breath from the inside out. Child’s Pose is a great way to take a break and relax during your yoga practice, or anytime you feel tired or overwhelmed.</i>

Lower your upper body over the bent leg, either all the way to the floor or resting on your elbows. Slowly inhale and exhale five times. Before you change sides, push back on your left leg to stretch the calf muscles. Repeat with your left leg bent and right leg extended.This pose is a favorite for runners because it boosts hip flexibility and also releases the glutes and low back, Lawrence says. "If you run, lift weights, do CrossFit, or Spin, you must do this stretch to keep strong and flexible and enhance your performance." It may be challenging at first, but you'll learn to love this pose, Lawrence promises."</i>
