                  Even it doesn’t seem to bother you right now, it’s still good to give your neck a little stretch once in a while.First, make sure you’re in a comfortable seat with your hands resting on your knees. Sit upright and relax your shoulders, and push your chin against your chest to straighten your spine. Next, gently roll your head to the right or left until your ear touches your shoulder - use one hand to push your head, and the other to slowly push your opposite shoulder in the other direction."

                A good stretch on the back is what office workers need!
                Shoulder rolls are the perfect exercise for removing accumulated stress and tension in the shoulders and improving the circulation in those joints. This exercise warms up and stretches the muscles, tendons, and joints and helps reduce pain and stiffness in the shoulder area.Sitting upright, lift your right shoulder to your ear.
                Slowly roll your shoulder around and back, dropping it away from your ear.
                Lift your left shoulder to your ear. Slowly roll your shoulder around and back, dropping it away from your ear.
                Continue these rolls three more times, alternating right and left.
Lift both shoulders up to your ears and hold for a breath. Release them, slowly rolling your shoulders around and back, dropping them away from your ear. Repeat five times and then relax your shoulders.

                Tight chest muscles can lead to shoulder pain, neck pain, difficulty taking deep breaths, and difficulty lifting heavy things. Stretching your chest activates the chest muscles, stimulates blood flow, and can increase your short-term range of motion and flexibility.Sit near the edge of your chair and interlace your fingers behind you, palms together and facing your back.
Lean forward slightly, lifting your arms so that you feel the stretch in your chest.
Inhale slowly, lifting your chest.
Exhale and relax your shoulders away from your ears.
Hold for 10 to 15 breaths.
Slowly release your hands and return them to your sides.Healthy adults should do flexibility exercises for all major muscle-tendon groups—neck, shoulders, chest, trunk, lower back, hips, legs, and ankles—at least two to three times a week. For optimal results, you should spend a total of 60 seconds on each stretching exercise.

Breathe deeply, focusing on lengthening your spine.
