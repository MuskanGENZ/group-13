                The biggest hurdle that many of us face on the path to fitness
                and good health is definitely laziness. After all, just the
                thought of giving up the comfort of your cozy, inviting bed to
                work out can be nauseating. But, what if we told you that you
                could work out—without getting out of bed? Yes, you read that
                right.Including a few stretches in your morning routine can give
                you a toned body, along with a calming start to your day.Usually
                mornings are hectic and one tends to jump right out to get on
                with the day’s activities

                  subtle exercises such as gentle rotation of your neck, arms,
                  wrists, and ankles to slowly warm up the joints. Practice
                  simple breathing techniques with your eyes closed and a
                  straight spine. This will prepare your body for the practice,
                  and keep you safe from practice-related injuries. Also, make
                  sure that your bed is not too soft, in which case you should
                  perform these asanas on a yoga mat.Find music that makes you
                  feel relaxed, or use white noise.Once you’re done with this
