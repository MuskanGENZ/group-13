Practice simple breathing techniques with your eyes closed and a straight spine. This will prepare your body for the practice, and keep you safe from practice-related injuries. Also, make sure that your bed is not too soft, in which case you should perform these asanas on a yoga mat.Find music that makes you feel relaxed, or use white noise.Once you’re done with this warm-up, gear up for these yoga poses you can do in bed recommended by us."</i>
